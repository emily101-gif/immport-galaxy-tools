  <description>using FlowSOM.
long_description: |
    **Input**
   This tool compares FCS files or flowframes from a data collection to the reference Self-Organizing Map generated by a FlowSOM run. The same data collection merged and run with FlowSOM should ideally be used to ensure consistency in the attribution of events to clusters or meta-clusters.
    **Output**
   Each individual FCS files or flowframe from the input collection is mapped to the reference tree, and a table mapping events to FlowSOM clusters or meta-clusters is generated for each. Two sets of plots can be optionally generated, one representing the resulting SOM Trees, and the other displaying each marker's contribution to the trees. The text files can be used as input for vizualisation tools. A table of the custer or meta-cluster composition of each file is generated as well as MFI and population descriptive statistics.
